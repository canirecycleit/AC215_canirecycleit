# Project - CanIRecycleIt.com

## Problem Definition(s)

* Consumers placing non-recyclable items in recycle bins leads to [inefficiencies](https://www.valleywasteservice.com/valley-waste-news/what-happens-if-you-put-non-recyclable-items-into-recycling-4034).

* Consumers trying to buy recyclable products [may not know if recyclable or not](https://news.slashdot.org/story/21/09/09/153219/california-aims-to-ban-recycling-symbols-on-things-that-arent-recyclable).

## Proposed Solution

Build binomial classification model for recylcable/non-recylcable

Build multinomial classification for material identification (e.g. plastic. metal, etc.)

Provide standard data model for upload of labeled images for ongoing classification model build/improvement

Provide UI (canIrecyclethis.com) and API for real-time inference

## Project Scope

Classification Categories.  Not clear what ideal classification/label strategies would be to support desired use-cases.

## Draft Timeline 

## Datasets and Models considered

Data.  Could start with https://github.com/garythung/trashnet/blob/master/data/dataset-resized.zip but may require additional training images.  Unlikely to start out as very robust vs. all consumer products (thus ongoing learning/training cycle with user feedback).
